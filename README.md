The area of a circle is defined as $\pi\times r^2$. That means $\pi = \text{circle area} / r^2$. Notice that $r^2$ is the area of a square of side $r$ (let's call it the small square). Hence, the last formula can now be written as: $\pi = \text{circle area} / \text{small square area}$. Notice that the area of the small square is one fourth  the area of the big one. Hence we can write $\pi = 4 \times \text{circle area} / \text{big square area}$. On the other hand, if we randomly generate points inside the big square, the number of points inside the circle is supposed to be proportional to the area of the circle. Similarly, the total number of points within the big square is supposed to be proportional to the area of the square. Hence $\pi = 4 \times \text{circle area} / \text{big square area} = 4 \times \text{number inside circle} / \text{total number}$.

The predictive aspect of Monte Carlo process is also revealed by the blue points that are progressively tracing the shape of a circle. The circle is becomming smoother and smoother as we increase the number of points.
